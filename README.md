# Fishing Contest
Fishing contest leaderboard website written with Django. This has been developed for the White Lake Sport Fishing Association's Kid's Fishing Contest, an annual fishing contest for kids.

Kids are divided by gender and age group. The app allows for fast entry of kids information, and allows the weight of each fish they catch to be recorded. A scrolling leaderboard page shows the results for each age group and gender.

The database is sqlite. The code is mixed between Django/python and HTML/Javascript/css.
